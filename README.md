# REACT STARTER PACK
This is my starter pack for delevopment of react application.

## Motivation
I don't like create react app for having the setup hidden under the hood. This is basic config for further configuration. The current enviroment doesn't bind you to the tools and you always have direct access to your environment settings.

## Ð¡ontains
1. base configure webpack
2. configure babel
3. add typescript
4. configure eslint with airbnb config
